Implement a CRUD REPL

Create a record: ask the user for each attribute, add a new contact to your contact list with the attributes that the user entered.
Retrieve a record: ask the user for the contact's name, find the user with the given name, and display their information
Update a record: ask the user for the contact's name, then for which attribute of the user they'd like to update and the value of the attribute they'd like to set.
Delete a record: ask the user for the contact's name, remove the contact with the given name from the contact list.
